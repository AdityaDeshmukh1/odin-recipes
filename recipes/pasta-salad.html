    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta salad (pasta fredda) is a salad dish prepared with one or more types of pasta, almost always chilled, and most often tossed in a vinegar, oil, or mayonnaise-based dressing. It is typically served as an appetizer, side dish or a main course. Pasta salad is often regarded as a spring or summertime meal, but it can be served any time of year.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pasta</strong>: This colorful, top-rated pasta salad starts with one pound of tri-colored spiral pasta. </li>

            <li><strong>Dressing</strong>: Use a bottle of store-bought Italian-style dressing or, if you want to go the extra mile, make your own at home. </li>

            <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> mix: Salad seasoning mix lends tons of savory flavor. </li>

            <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: You'll need cherry tomatoes, three bell peppers (green, yellow, and red), and a can of black olives. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes; rinse under cold water and drain.</li>

            <li>Whisk Italian dressing and salad spice mix together until smooth. Combine pasta, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives in a salad bowl.</li>

            <li>Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat.</li>

            <li>Refrigerate salad, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
